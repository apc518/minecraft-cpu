This is my first ever Minecraft CPU, created in collaboration with Peer Carnes.

We created a [custom assembly language](https://github.com/apc518/minecraft-cpu/tree/master/asm), including an assembler written in python, and an example program that calculates fibbonaci numbers.

## Specs
- 8 bit instructions and registers
- 2 registers
- 16 bytes of RAM
- 16 bytes of read-only instruction memory
- 0.1hz clock

## Potential Future Work
- Add base-ten display
